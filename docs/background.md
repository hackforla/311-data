# Project Background and Resources

The following resources provide good context for the project.

## [LA 311 System Online](https://myla311.lacity.org/)

The web version of the 311 system. For Los Angeles-based team members a good introduction to the project would be to create a service request ticket (there is likely graffiti or trash somewhere that you can report) and get first-hand knowledge of the system.

## [EmpowerLA](http://empowerla.org/)

The Los Angeles city department focused on community engagement and technology adoption.
