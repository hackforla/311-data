## Notes on `ready for peer review` Label

The `ready for peer review` label should be checked weekly to ensure:
1. Issues with this label are properly tracked in project board views
2. The label doesn't interfere with existing label searches and filters
3. Peer review status is visible and actionable for the team

This label is particularly important for maintaining code quality and ensuring proper review processes are followed before merging changes.
