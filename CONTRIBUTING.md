# Engineering Getting Started
Welcome! This readme assumes you have already listened to the 311-data pitch, and gone through the basic onboarding. The following will be more geared towards the programming side of 311-data and getting your development environment setup. If you run into any problems, please submit a new issue.

## Feature Branching
For development we use feature branching to ensure easy collaboration. There aren't any rules to branch naming or how many branches you are allowed to have, but the recommended convention would look like `issueId-Prefix-MinimalDescription`
For example, a documentation branch could look like `138-DOC-OnboardingUpdate`.

Read more about feature branching [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Default Branch
Building on feature branching, we treat the 'main' branch as the primary contribution branch. Pull requests to this branch should be as frequent as developers are closing issues (Hopefully very frequent!). Pushes to 'main' will require approval from assigned reviewers before the developer can push and merge their changes.

In other words, whenever you are about to start on a new feature, checkout a new local branch based off of the main branch. Your command would look something like `git checkout -b 567-BACK-NewEndpoint`. See [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4470523/create-a-branch-in-git-from-another-branch) for more context.

## Labels and Project Management

We use GitHub labels to organize and track issues throughout their lifecycle. Key labels include:

### Ready for Review Labels
- `ready for peer review` - Issue/PR is ready for peer review from team members
- `ready for product` - Issue needs product team review
- `ready for dev lead` - Issue needs development lead review
- `ready for design lead` - Issue needs design lead review

These labels help ensure proper review processes are followed and maintain visibility in project board views.

## Branch Protection/Github Actions (to be implemented)
We use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run our continuous integration (CI). These actions include status checks that run whenever you submit a pull request to main. When you submit a PR, Github will run a set of operations to build and test all or part of the codebase. If any of these steps fail, the pull request will not be allowed to be merged until they are fixed. From the pull request UI you can find the reason an operation may have failed in the status checks section towards the bottom.

If you want to look at our setup, check out the "Actions" tab in Github, as well as the [workflows directory](https://github.com/hackforla/311-data/tree/master/.github/workflows), which contains the code that Github runs when actions are triggered.

In addition to status checks, PR's are required to have at least one reviewer before being merged into `main`.

## Testing
Tests help instill confidence in pull requests because a developer can say "All the status checks pass and my new tests pass so the PR is safe to merge". When contributing new features, it is most ideal to write at least 4 tests targeting your code.
  - One for the "happy path"
    - Test the endpoint/feature in the way it is intended to be used
  - One for the "extreme path"
    - Test with extreme inputs/characteristics (What if I use 10,000 XYZ)
  - One for the "negative path"
    - Test with strange input, (What if I send characters to a function that expects integers)
  - One for the "null path"
    - Test with empty params/nothing/emptiness

### Frontend testing
Our frontend tests are run through [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). Vitest serves as a drop-in replacement for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

#### Intro
If you're unfamiliar with writing UI tests, we recommend reading docs for React Testing Library and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests) to learn the basic concepts of integration testing a Redux app.

The structure of a frontend integration test is "arrange, act, assert":

1. Arrange: Render some UI
2. Act: Simulate user interactions
3. Assert: Expect certain state changes in the UI

#### In 311-Data
Frontend testing for 311-Data is currently a work in progress. Example tests are provided in two files:

1. utils.test.js demonstrates unit testing non-UI code.
2. FilterMenu.test.jsx demonstrates integration testing UI code. This follows the "arrange, act, assert" procedure mentioned above.

You can refer to these files as examples of how to write additional tests for 311-Data with Vitest and React Testing Library.

#### Where to put test files

Test files are placed in the same directory as the file that they test. This makes the association between application code and test code clear.
